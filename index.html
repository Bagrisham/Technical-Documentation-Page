                        This is formated like a technical document for a project. Not very pretty, but I had no desire to spend ages making micro-adjustments.

                <h2>This is just a model.</h2>
                <p>Obviously I know how to be a web-developer. I know:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>

                <h2>What about PHP?</h2>
                <p>Here we go. The <span>PHP</span> question.<br> Yeah, I know how to use PHP. It's ancient and not too complex (usually).<br> 
				Look, we can debate syntax for ages, but if it works and it has proper comments, do you care?</p>
                <div class="example-box">
                    <h3>For Example:</h3>
                    <p>I tend to use StackOverflow and Google.</p>
                    <code>
                        The answer is there. <br> Should I make it from scratch and waste hours\have errors or move forward with the current project?

                </div>
                <p>Put a problem in front of me and I'll find the solution.<br>
				Knowing the fundamentals is important, but you don't bake bread from scratch every time, right?
				<br>I have a firm grasp on syntax and documentation, so that should be good enough to do whatever job you need.</p>

            <div class="content-container">
                <h2>Sorry</h2>
                <p>Look, I care about efficiency. <br>
				My time is best spent getting things done.
				<br> Yeah, you need people who know how to do everything from a blank slate.
				<br> I'm the one that can do what they do in a third of the time, understand the code, and move on.</p>

            <div class="content-container">
                <h2>I'm average.</h2>
                <p>
                    Maybe above-average. Depends on the situation or project.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I know my limits. I'm not going to make grand claims about my skillset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to foster personal improvement. That's the reason for these goofy projects.
                </p>
                <p>
					Hopefully my portfolio is good enough. I think it is.
